    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be using a database of geographic data provided for you in the PySal library to create two plots, a choropleth map and a proportional symbol map. In addition to these two plots, you will compute the value of Moran's I for this data.\n",

    "The dataset to be used in this assignment is a dataset containing Per Capita incomes for the United States' lower 48 states. In addition to the state-by-state data, the dataset contains shape files for each state that you can use\n",
    "to create the choropleth and proportional symbol maps.\n",

    "This assignment will be graded by Coursera's grading system. In order for your answers to be correctly registered in the system, you must place the code for your answers in the cell indicated for each question. In addition, you should submit the assignment with the output of the code in the cell's display area. The display area should contain only your answer to the question with no extraneous information, or else the answer may not be picked up correctly. Each cell that is going to be graded has a set of comment lines at the beginning of the cell. These lines are extremely important and must not be modified or removed."
